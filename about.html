        <h1>About This Campaign</h1>
        <p>
          This website was created as the final deliverable for an Emerging
          Technologies course. It pulls together multiple media pieces into one
          cohesive digital campaign about Credit Compass, a concept for an AI
          money coach for students.

          <h2>Campaign Purpose & Narrative</h2>
          <p>
            The main goal of this project is to explore how emerging AI tools
            could be used to make personal finance less confusing and more
            accessible for college students. Many students juggle classes, jobs,
            and family responsibilities while also trying to manage bills,
            credit cards, and loans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Credit Compass imagines an AI assistant that:
          </p>
          <ul class="meta-list">
            <li>Translates complex financial jargon into plain language</li>
            <li>Gives just-in-time reminders before late fees hit</li>
            <li>Helps students see how today’s choices affect future credit</li>
            <li>Coaches rather than judges, building confidence over time</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Across the social media strategy, infographic, video ad, and
            podcast, the narrative shifts from stress and confusion toward
            clarity and control. The campaign is meant to feel hopeful and
            realistic, not like a “perfect” fantasy where money problems vanish
            overnight.
